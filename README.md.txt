#Kickstarting with Excel

##Overview of Project

    The project answers two questions:
* What goal amount would fit the campaign best.
* When would be best to launch a play campaign.

###Purpose
The purpose of the challenge was to outcomes and suggestions based on launch dates of past campaign as well as goal set for those campaigns.

##Analysis and Challenges

###Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By analysing the outcomes based on launch date, one can clearly see that the months may, June and July were the most successful months to launch a campaign with may being the month with the most successful campaigns, followed by June and July respectively. The data also suggests the December is the worst time to launch a campaign with a failure rate of close to 50%
###Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
By analysing the outcomes based on goals, it is clear that a goal in the range of 45,000 to 49,999 is the worst goal to pick as the data suggests there is a 100% failure rate, then again there is only 1 data point for this range so one cannot confidently say a goal in this range will fail, the data also suggests, that the goals with the highest success rate are goal of <1000, 1000<4999 and 35000<45000.
###Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

##Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
* The months May, June and July are the best months to launch a campaign
* The month December is the worst month to launch a campaign
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
* The smaller campaigns with a goal of <5000 are most likely to succeed, 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
* Difficult to come to a good conclusion on plays based on campaign goals more data for plays could have been useful.
